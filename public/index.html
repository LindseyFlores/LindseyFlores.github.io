                Welcome to a portion of my brain. My name is Lindsey Flores!
                There are many things enjoy to do, but here are some main points about me.
            <ul>
                <li>What am I up to?</li>
                <li>Beep Boop</li>
                <li>More About me</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="imageOfMe">

                    alt="The browser you are using doesnt support my image :O">

            </p>

            <h1>What am I up to?</h1>
            <p>
                Currently, I am finishing up my Computer Science Degree at the University of North Carolina at
                Greensboro, where I have obtained a great portion of my programming knowledge. 
                During my enrollment, I have been working at 6-TECH, the technology department the university. Here I
                have gained experience in systems analysis, hardware management and worked with the cloud-computing
                service SERVICENOW platform. 
            </p>
            <h1>Beep Boop?</h1>
            <p>
                I love computers. On my free time I try to spend as much of it as possible learning technology, creating
                things with it or just writing code. As a full-stack developer, I enjoy doing a little bit of everything. 
                However, I will say I have found a profound enjoyment in web-developement. I am aware that HTML/CSS are really considered as programming languages, 
                but design is an important component So i have them listed in my top 4 programming languages.
            </p>
            <p> Top 4 Programming Languages:</p>
                <ul class="languages"> 
                    <li class="javascript">Javascript</li>
                    <li class="java">Java</li>
                    <li class="python">Python</li>
                    <li class="html-css">HTML/CSS</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h3>Projects:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>breakItDown: </b> This is my current project, where I hope to make it easier for people to read terms and conditions using AI. </li>
                <li> <b>Allerfence:</b> a platform enabling individuals with dietary restrictions to safely order from
                    restaurants, addressing allergen concerns.</li>
                <li> <b>theBasics:</b> an online clothing store project, enhancing user experience with a responsive design
                    while integrating third-party APIs for expanded functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
                This isn't a software project, but I am interested in <strong> Raspberry Pi's </strong> so I am working on a side DIY smart mirror. <br>
            </p>
            
            <h1>Fun Facts about me:</h1>
            <p>
                I can play guitar, but it can get hard to find time for everything sometimes so practicing a musical instrument has been top on a priority list :) 
                But thats okay, I love listening to music and always have something playing in the background. According to spotify these are my top genres:
                <ul>
                    <li>Latin</li>
                    <li>Rock</li>
                    <li>Metal</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p> I used to be on my university's rugby team! </p>
